# OpenASSA - POC_Julia

openASSA is an initiative by members of the Actuarial Society of South Africa to develop open-source actuarial software. The project is still very new and the design and goals are currently being discussed.

If you're interested in joining the discussion, please join our [Slack channel](https://communityinviter.com/apps/openassa/openassa).

Please note **this is work in progress for OpenASSA's poc.**

It is a 1st attempt using Julia to create an understanding and visibility about OpenASSA's vision.

## Getting Started

This program uses pyspark to produce cash flows for a simple life insurance product and present values the cash flows to get a reserve amount.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
This code can be run on a local machine. These instructions are for a local install.
The following is needed for a local install, Julia, Julia JSON library.



### Installing

The following link gives a step by step instruction on how to setup a Julia environment for windows.

## Deployment

Open Juno, open the file OpenASSA.jl. When running for the first time install the JSON package for Julia. This can be found at https://github.com/JuliaIO/JSON.jl. Then added the package by running Pkg.add("JSON"). To run the program change the directory of the location for the files to the local directory where it has been installed and run the code.
