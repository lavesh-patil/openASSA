# OpenASSA - POC1_Sean

openASSA is an initiative by members of the Actuarial Society of South Africa to develop open-source actuarial software. The project is still very new and the design and goals are currently being discussed.

If you're interested in joining the discussion, please join our [Slack channel](https://communityinviter.com/apps/openassa/openassa).

Please note **this is work in progress for OpenASSA's poc.**

It is a 1st attempt using pyspark to create an understanding and visibility about OpenASSA's vision.

## Getting Started

This program uses pyspark to produce cash flows for a simple life insurance product and present values the cash flows to get a reserve amount.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
This code can be run on a local machine as well as a cluster (e.g. AWS or Azure). These instructions are for a local install.
The following is needed for a local install, Java, Python and spark.



### Installing

The following link gives a step by step instruction on how to setup the environment for windows.
