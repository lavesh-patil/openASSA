Hi all,

Here are the (delayed) minutes of the WG2 meeting from 6 October 2020.

There were 2 main points of discussion.

1. Since this openASSA project is endorsed by ASSA, we need a code of conduct for our online spaces, for example the Slack channel, Github repo, etc. You are all requested to send your comments about what should be included in the Code of Conduct to Kobus Engelbrech ( kobus.engelbrecht@liberty.co.za ), who will collate it.

2. For interested users who are new to git version control, we will choose a recommended git client and set up documentation on the Github wiki for the basic steps to get started with git and Github. Divan Gouws has already created an online poll in our Slack channel ( https://openassa.slack.com/archives/C01BUJZM006 ). You're welcome to vote in the poll and suggest other alternatives. For users who are already comfortable with git, you're welcome to use any client of your choice. We just want to have a recommendation for new users. Francois Botha volunteered to create the wiki pages once the recommendations have been chosen.

Have a great weekend.

regards

Francois Botha
